Licenses:
- Fake86 CPU emulator: GPL
- ibxm mod-player license: 3-clause BSD
- Rest of the firmware, PCB artwork, case design: Beer-ware
- Sources in original_pbf_src: Unknown / no license. Reproduced here under
  the assumption it's okay given it's also available at
  https://github.com/historicalsource/pinballfantasies and presumably
  put there by a rightsholder.
- Binaries of Pinball Fantasies: Not included. Buy your own from
  gog.com or elsewhere. Given we do not modify the binaries and buying it
  gives you the right to run them, I imagine there's no license violation
  in using them here.
